# Veil Environment Configuration Example
# Copy this to .env.local for local overrides

# Demo mode - enables demo badge and simulated transactions
# Set to 'true' to enable demo mode with a pre-populated badge
# Set to 'false' or remove for production with real wallet operations
VITE_DEMO_MODE=true

# Use mock prover (instant, no real ZK proofs)
# Set to 'true' for local development without waiting for proofs
# Set to 'false' or remove for production with real ZK proofs
VITE_USE_MOCK_PROVER=true

# Prover endpoint configuration
# NOTE: Vite automatically loads environment-specific files:
# - .env.development (loaded by 'npm run dev')
# - .env.production (loaded by 'npm run build')
# - .env.local (overrides everything, not committed to git)

# Development via Vite proxy (RECOMMENDED - avoids CORS issues)
# Uses Vite's built-in proxy configured in vite.config.ts
# VITE_PROVER_ENDPOINT=/api/charms/spells/prove

# Production (direct API - may have CORS issues from browser)
# VITE_PROVER_ENDPOINT=https://v8.charms.dev/spells/prove
